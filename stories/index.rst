My Little Slice of the Internet
===============================

Hi!

My name is Adam Miller, I am a computer geek and this is my tiny corner of the
internet.

What I look like
================

If we have the opportunity to meet in person, this is roughly what you should be
looking for.

About Me
========

I am a loving husband and father, an open source fanatic, a member of the
`Ansible <https://ansible.com>`_ Engineering Team, a `Fedora
<https://getfedora.org/>`_ contributor, `Red Hatter <https://www.redhat.com/>`_,
and over all lover of technology.

I go by **maxamillion** in most areas of the social web and can often be found
there (except Twitter, I was late to that game).

To the left you will find various items about me including my blog.

Be warned that I tend to complain about software on Twitter. :)
